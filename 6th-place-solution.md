First of all, Thank you to RSNA and Kaggle for hosting this competition.  
Congratulations to all competitors. 
My solution is based on my mistakes in past RSNA competitions and solutions I learned from great competitors.


## Data
I use the datasets from @theoviel. Thanks for him.  
I make 5 folds based on patient id (n=3147).  



## Models
I divided task based on the label type.
* **Organ Model** : Seg Label(nii) + Study Label
* **Bowel Model** : Seg Label(nii) + Study Label + Image Label
* **Extra Model** : Study Label + Image Label

### 1) Organ Model
First, I trained 3D segmentation model for generating masks.  
And I cropped organ and get 15 slices for each one.  
Because I got many ideas from previous RSNA competitions, I started to use adjacent +-2 channels.  
And I just tried only 1 slices with 5 channels because I want to see how different, but it performs better.  
So finally I used this way. But, I think the original method makes more sense.

And then I trained CNN + sequence model With cropped volumes and study label.  


Model:  
1. 3D segmentation : generate masks and crop (15 slices in each organ) 
    * resnet18d
2. CNN 2.5D + sequence : train Organ classifier with study label.
    * efficientnetv2s + LSTM
    * seresnext50_32x4d + LSTM
     


### 2) Bowel Model
The 3D segmentation part is same with above.    
The only difference is I cropped 30 slices for bowel.   

I trained also CNN + sequence model with cropped volumes and study and image label.  

Model:  
1. 3D segmentation : generate masks and crop (30 slices in each organ)
    * resnet18d
2. CNN 2.5D + sequence : train Organ classifier with study label and image label.
    * efficientnetv2s + LSTM
    * seresnext50_32x4d + LSTM


### 3) Extra Model
For Extra model, I got slices with stride 5 and +-2 adjacent channels.  
For example, each image shape is (5, size, size) and 5 channels are [n-2, n-1, n, n+1, n+2].  
Also I just resized images to 384. I tried the other ways like 512 size, cropped images, but not working well. 

Extra Model is based on 2 stage.  
First, I trained Feature extractor and got feature embeddings.   
Second, I trained Sequence Model.   

These are enough for gold zone.  
In addition, thanks to Ian's bbox label, I could improve Extra model more.  

In my experiment, training detector with bbox label is not working.  
So I used this label to make model to focus on extravasation region.
I added segmentation head to feature extractor and it worked well.

This idea to add segmentation head comes from the previous Siim competition.

Model:
1. Feature Extractor
    * seresnext50_32x4d
    * efficientnetv2s
2. Sequence
    * GRU

## Things that did not work
* Yolov7 + Ian Pan extravasation boxes. Training detector to crop bboxes is not working well.
* seperate organ model.  


I truly appreciate the many competitors who produce and share great solutions every time. 
Thanks to, I was able to learn so much and become a Kaggle master. 
Also, Thank you to host and everyone who contributes to the best solution.


## Code
The code will be released later.
